Demo repo for pull requests.

Instructions on managing branches and pull requests.

## Step One

Clone the repo locally by creating a local folder to hold the repo. Then run the following command.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:prof3ssorSt3v3/fictional-carnival.git .
```

The final period is important as it means to create the repo within the current folder.

## Step Two

Create your own local feature branch. Name it after yourself.

```bash
git checkout -B <your name here>
```

## Step Three

Create your own markdown file, also named after yourself.

> Eg: steve.md

## Step Four

After the demonstration and addition of the protections to the main branch...

...run the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to put your new branch into the repo.

## Step Five

Create a `Pull Request` which will ask the owner of the repo to merge the code back into the `main` branch.

## Step Six

The Repo owner will need to review the pull request, add comments, approve and merge the updated feature branch into the main branch. You can read more about
[managing pull requests here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request).
